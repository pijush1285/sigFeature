Description: This package provides a novel feature selection algorithm for binary 
             classification using support vector machine recursive feature elimination 
             SVM-RFE and Bayesian T statistic. In this feature selection process, the 
             selected features are differentially significant between the two classes 
             and also they are good classifier with higher degree of classification accuracy.
